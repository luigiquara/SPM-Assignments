Write a parallel program getting a vector of n floating point numbers with first position 0.0, last position 100.0 and intermediate position 25.0 and computing (in parallel) k iterations each re-computing position i in the vector (i in [1,n-2]) as the average of previous values of positions i, i-1 and i+1 (positions 0 and n never change).
