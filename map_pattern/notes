i = 0
pos = 0

while(pos < v.size())

first, start nw asyncs of the first nw position of the vector
i = nw
pos = nw

now, somehow get notified from a thread that it has finished
get its tid, assign to it a new job on the correct position
i = tid
new_pos = pos + tid, checking that new_pos < v.size()

the notification can be done with a vector of condition variables, one for thread
